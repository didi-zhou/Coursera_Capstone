    "### Introduction/Business Problem\n",
    "Seattle has been one of the fastest growing large American cities for nearly a decade. According to Washington Office of Financial Management (OFM) survey, Seattle's population grew by 22.78% between 2010 and 2019. There is not doubt that more people are attracted to this booming city to establish their own businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as the 15th largest city in the United States, Seattle is made up of over 30 neighborhoods. Each neighborhood has its own unqiue characteristics and the demographics of each neighborhood can also be very different. Therefore, it is difficult to determine where is the ideal location for a new business without an understanding of the target market. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this analysis is to provide essential data and assist a new business's location selection process. For illustration purpose, a new bakery is used as an example. This new bakery features top quality bread and pastries that are made with trendy ingredients. Its store environment is Instagram-worthy. Its target market is composed of young and educated individuals or families who have medium to high income level. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis goes through the data of each Seattle neighborhood from the following aspects:\n",
    "1. median age\n",
    "2. household income\n",
    "3. crime rate\n",
    "4. current market saturation "
